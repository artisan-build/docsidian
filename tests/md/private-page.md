# A Private Page

This page has been marked private and should not appear in the navigation unless the gate condition for private is satisfied. In the default service provider, the private gate simply returns false, so in order to test a scenario in which this page appears in the navigation, we'll have to find a way to override the defined gate from the test suite. Maybe not that important.
